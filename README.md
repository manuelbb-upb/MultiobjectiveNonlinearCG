# MultiobjectiveNonlinearCG


This is a package meant primarily for academic and research purposes.
For my own sanity, I have incorporated a few convenience functions,
but don't expect anything particularly usable or stable.

As things are changing fast behind the scenes, please refer to the [docs](https://manuelbb-upb.github.io/MultiobjectiveNonlinearCG/)
for usage hints.

The package is not (yet) registered, but you can install it from master via
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(;url="https://github.com/manuelbb-upb/MultiobjectiveNonlinearCG.git")
```
