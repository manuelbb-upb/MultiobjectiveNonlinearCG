# MultiobjectiveNonlinearCG.jl

Documentation for MultiobjectiveNonlinearCG.jl

This is a package meant primarily for academic and research purposes.
For my own sanity, I have incorporated a few convenience functions,
but don't expect anything particularly usable or stable.

Some of the theory behind this package, and results generated with it
are meant to be presented at GAMM2023 in Dresden.
